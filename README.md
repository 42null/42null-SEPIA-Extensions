# 42null-SEPIA-Extensions
This is my repository for the SEPIA framework extensions that I have written. I am so glad to have found a java based local processing voice assistant I would love to contrubute in the only way I know how.

<p><b>In Progress Extensions</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Basic Math:</b> A basic math extension that works offline without insted of attempting to conduct a web search.</li>
    <li><b>Abilities/Other info:</b><i>Untill the first pull request version is out, please read the release/commit notes or tell your assistant "Whatis/Calculate help" for more infromation.</i></li>
      <ol><b>Usage:</b>
        <li>The operators +−✕/÷^ work as well as their spelled out counterparts work in this program.</li>
        <li>Parenthesis "(" and ")" are supported and work as expected.</li>
        <li>Order of operations are supported and work as expected.</li>
        <li>The operator '*' or '!' does not presently work with this program. See past

        <li>Factorial is not supported unless 'expermentalMode' is enabled (use "f" as the operator),<i> this may not always work as intended</i>.</li>
        <li>For π you can copy and paste this symbol or use "pi", for point you can put a period, say "point" or "dot".</li>
        <li>Decimals as well as saying "negitive" or just "neg" before a number works. For refrence negitive is "−", while minus is "-".</li>
        <li>On top of the file you will see "#AREA FOR SETTING'S VARAIBLES", you can change the defaults of the program there. It is recomended you keep displayMode at 1 or 2.</li></p>
        </ol>
    </ul>
