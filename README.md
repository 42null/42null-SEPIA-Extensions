# 42null-SEPIA-Extensions
This is my repository for the SEPIA extensions that I have written. I am so glad to have found a Java based local processing voice assistant I would love to contrubute in the only way I know how.

<p><b>--Pre-Alpha Extensions--</b></p>
    <p2><b>Custom Web Search:</b> A simple search extension that generates a link to the search resaults of the webpage you would like to search.</p2>
       <ul>
            <li>After configuration, simpay type or say "Search &lttrigger word&gt for &ltphrase to search&gt" and a link will be provided for you connecting you to the search resaults of your request.</li>
           <li>You can include "for" in your search operation, however, it will be ignored if it is the first search word used.</li>
       </ul>
<p><b>--Paused Extensions--</b>

<p2><b>Basic Math:</b> A basic math extension that works offline without insted of attempting to conduct a web search.</p2>
<ul>
    <li><b>Abilities/Other info:</b><i>Untill the first pull request version is out, please read the release/commit notes or tell your assistant "Whatis/Calculate help" for more infromation.</i></li>
      <ol><b>Usage:</b>
        <li>The operators +−✕*/÷^ work as well as their spelled out counterparts work in this program. However due to bigDecimal, only whole numbers will be used as expodents.</li>
        <li>Parenthesis "(" and ")" are supported and work as expected.</li>
        <li>Order of operations are supported and work as expected.</li>
        <li>The operator '*' or '!' does not presently work with this program. See past 
<a href="https://github.com/42null/42null-SEPIA-Extensions/commit/e32e8180075e8335b8565f68b184c61a82f01af7" target="_blank">version</a>s for details or #allowAstric.</li>
        <li>Factorial is not supported unless 'expermentalMode' is enabled (use "f" as the operator),<i> this may not always work as intended</i>.</li>
        <li>For π you can copy and paste this symbol or use "pi", for point you can put a period, say "point" or "dot".</li>
        <li>Decimals as well as saying "negitive" or just "neg" before a number works. For refrence negitive is "−", while minus is "-".</li>
        <li>On top of the file you will see "#AREA FOR SETTING'S VARAIBLES", you can change the defaults of the program there. It is recomended you keep displayMode at 1 or 2.</li></p>
        </ol>
    </ul>
</ul>
