# 42null-SEPIA-Extensions
This is my repository for the SEPIA framework extensions that I have written. I am so glad to have found a java based local processing voice assistant I would love to contrubute in the only way I know how.

<p><b>In Progress Extensions</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Basic Math:</b> A math extension that works offline without calling Google</li>
    <li><b>Abilities/Other info:</b><i>Untill the first publicly released version is out, please read the release/commit notes or tell your assistant "Whatis/Calculate help" for more infromation.</i></li>
      <ol><b>Usage:</b>
        <li>The operators +-✕/÷^ work as well as plus, minus, times, as well as others in this program.</li>
        <li><b>!!!</b> The operator '*' or '!' does not presently work with this program. This is difffent also the case for negitive pi. I am thinking about filling out a bug report as even a basic extenstion with no language diffrention still crashes if a number or certain words were used, even if the only thing it is doing is just one line in extract returing what was said (or even just a static string). </li>
        <li>Factorial is not supported unless 'expermentalMode' is enabled (use "f" as the operator).</li>
        <li>For π you can copy and paste this symbol or use "pi", for point you can put a period, say point or dot.</li>
        <li>Decimals as well as saying negitive or just neg before a number works (<i>see </i><b>!!!</b><i> for exceptions</i>).</li>
        <li>On top of the file you will see a"#AREA FOR SETTING'S VARAIBLES", you can change the defaults of the program there.</li></p>
        </ol>
    </ul>
</ul>
<p><b>Future Extensions</b></p>
